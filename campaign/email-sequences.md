### Email 3: Cost of Confusion (Day 5)
**Subject:** The hidden cost of benefits confusion

Hi [[FIRST_NAME]],

Here's a sobering statistic: Companies lose an average of $1,200 per employee annually due to poor benefits communication.

**How does this happen?**

‚ùå **Underutilization** - Employees skip valuable benefits they don't understand
‚ùå **Poor choices** - Confusion leads to suboptimal plan selections  
‚ùå **HR overhead** - Endless questions consume valuable time
‚ùå **Compliance risks** - Unclear communication creates legal exposure

**The typical company with 200 employees loses $240,000 per year.**

**Good news:** Professional benefits communication typically pays for itself within 60 days through:
- Reduced HR support time
- Better benefit plan utilization
- Fewer enrollment errors and changes
- Improved employee satisfaction

**Example:** A client with 150 employees invested $6,498 in our Better package and saved over $180,000 in the first year through reduced HR time and better benefit choices.

### Email 5: Objection Handling (Day 10)
**Subject:** "Our employees don't watch videos"

Hi [[FIRST_NAME]],

I hear this objection sometimes: *"Our employees don't watch videos."*

I get it. Generic corporate videos can be painful. But benefits videos are different.

**Here's why employees actually watch benefits videos:**

‚úÖ **Personal relevance** - Their money and health are on the line
‚úÖ **Time-sensitive** - Open enrollment has real deadlines
‚úÖ **Clear value** - They need this information to make decisions
‚úÖ **Convenient format** - 2-3 minutes vs. 20-page PDFs

**The proof is in our analytics:**
- Average 87% completion rate (industry standard is 35%)
- 94% watch within first 48 hours of sending
- 73% watch multiple times before enrollment

**Real client feedback:**
*"I was skeptical about video, but our completion rates speak for themselves. Even our most resistant employees watched the whole thing."* - Michael Chen, HR Director

**The secret?** We don't make "corporate videos." We make clear, conversational explainers that respect people's time and intelligence.

Want to see exactly how we do it?

### Email 6: Urgency & Scarcity (Day 12)
**Subject:** Open enrollment season is coming fast

Hi [[FIRST_NAME]],

Quick question: When is your next open enrollment period?

If it's in the next 3-4 months, we need to talk soon.

**Here's why timing matters:**

üìÖ **Production time** - 10 business days for video creation
üîç **Review cycles** - Time for legal/compliance approval  
üìß **Distribution planning** - Integration with your communication timeline
üéØ **Employee preparation** - Early awareness drives better outcomes

**Peak season reality:** September through November is our busiest time. Many clients book 2-3 months in advance to guarantee their spot.

**Don't wait until the last minute.** Rushed projects stress everyone and compromise quality.
