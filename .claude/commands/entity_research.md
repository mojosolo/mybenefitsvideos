Run a lightweight, domain-agnostic research pass on a single entity (asset, product, company, policy, document, etc.).

- Ask for the entity name/identifier if not provided
- Use project agents if available (prefer `entity-analyzer`); otherwise perform your own research
- Include timestamp, key current metrics, recent developments, sentiment/reception, domain-appropriate indicators, fundamentals, risks, and a concise outlook
- Cite sources for major claims
