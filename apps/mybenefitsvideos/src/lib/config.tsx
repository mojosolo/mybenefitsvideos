      question: "What makes benefits videos effective?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Benefits videos combine visual storytelling with clear explanations to make
          complex benefits information easy to understand. Our videos increase employee
          engagement by 3x compared to traditional PDF benefits guides and help
          employees make better benefits decisions.

      ),

      question: "How long does it take to create a benefits video?",
